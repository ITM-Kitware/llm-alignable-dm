You called the medical transport service for one seriously injured patient, who needs to go to a major surgical hospital. Although they are stable, the longer they wait for surgery, the lower their chances for a full recovery and the higher their chances are for a permanent disability. As you are ready to load the patient, a search and rescue team calls to say that they are about an hour away with a patient with critical injuries who also needs to be transported. Because of the tides, the boat can either leave right now or will have to wait up to 8 hours until the tide begins to come in again. If they leave now, the distance and tides mean that the boat will not be able to return for 18 hours, which is likely too late to save the second patient.",
